Work Experience
--------
- <datetime>2020.09 - Current </datetime> <head_><head_title> Data Scientist </head_title> @ Barclays </head_>
<description><small>
Tech stack: Spark / PySpark (on Elastic Data Platform), Amazon Deep Java Library (DJL), Tensorflow / Keras, BitBucket, Neo4J, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Pretrained Transformers / RNNs / Likelihood Ratio  
<ul>
<li>
 Company address matching and entity matching without internal GPU and labeled data available. Solve using an active learning method. 
 Start from constructing some small datasets only with external data and training an XGBoost tree, then label samples in the boundary and fine-turning BERT models in an iterative way. Finish the inference on 1.5 million internal samples with this model on a CPU cluster, using a DJL based pipeline built from scratch on my own. It achieved a very satisfying result of 94% F1 score on a noisy validation dataset.   
</li>
<li>
Work on a project for predicting user's transaction activity using Informer, to analyse the effects of system downtime to customer.
</li>
<li>
Maintain the Spark cluster for the team, and build up pipelines for distributed inference by combining DJL / PySpark UDF with models.
</li>
<li>
Participated in a fully immersed 6-weeks cloud DevOps training, which involves the deployment of a working pipeline including GitHub, DockerHub, Jenkins and AWS EKS (Kubernetes) cluster, using Terraform and Ansible.
</li>
</ul>

- <datetime>2020.08 - 2020.09</datetime><head_><head_title>Natural Language Processing Engineer</head_title> @ Kwai Inc (Kuaishou) </head_>
<description><small>
<ul>
<li>Model Migrations for an newly built internal model management system</li>
<li>Maintain an internal inference system, build upon Spring</li>
<li>Retaining a transformer-based user language model using newly incoming data (~ millions, fetched by Hive SQL) to mitigate data shift issue</li>
</ul>  
With more than 300 million daily active users (DAU), Kwai is one of the largest short video sharing and live streaming social platforms in mainland China and the world. It was a great experience. My leave was for a better work-life balance, and a plan to travel around Europe.

Selected Projects
--------
- <datetime>2021.09 - 2021.10</datetime> <head_><head_title>Wechat chat history analysis</head_title> </head_>
<description>
<small>
It's a gift for one of my friends for a friendship anniversary. I collected all of our chat history (in Chinese). Take an analysis for the following aspects: the emotion appeared in our single chat sentences (80% accuracy for fine-turning a Chinese version Roberta model for a 6-classes dataset including happy, natural, angry, fearful, anxious, exciting), word cloud generation, Wechat emoji counting, and hourly chat statistics. The final delivery is a mobile html5 page constructed using a library wechat-h5-boilerplate. This was end-to-end project from data collection (WeChat does not provide any public way of exporting chat history).

Social media posting language source identification (tweets and gabs) project.
Finished a crawler for collecting language (posts) data from Gab.com, pre-processed data using Regular Expression, built models for classifying the source of these data by fine-turning BERT and XLNet,
visualized results using t-SNE, did "leave-one-hashtag-out" cross-validation, and evaluated models using some common matrics (Accuracy, F1 score, Confusion Matrix, Matthews Correlation Coefficient).

<description><small>
We fine-turned Google BERT to CommonsenseQA challenge 1.0 (with 3 options of each question) and then integrated Conceptnet Numberbatch and ELMo embeddings attempting to improve the model performance. The challenge involves a set of MCQ questions requiring human commonsense knowledge.
We achieved 68.79% of accuracy on validation set using BERT + ELMo (soly BERT : 67.47%; BERT + Numberbatch: 67.68%).

</small>
</techstack>
<description><small>
Predict whether a user would click the online AD (advertisement) on an AD real-time DSP bidding history dataset. The prediction results then were inputted to a bidding strategy function to predict a bid price. The dataset is unbalanced with only about 3000 positive samples (clicks) among more than 300000 bidding records. We tried many different models (XGBoosting, Shallow NN, Logistic Regression) and some bidding strategies. We also applied downsampling and re-calibration techniques in the project. We had a competition with other students (30 groups) and ranked in the 3rd place. </small>
